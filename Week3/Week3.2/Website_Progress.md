# Website Progress - Mid-Bootcamp Checklist

## Congratulations, we are halfway through!
- Over the past three weeks, we have covered so much material on how to build a website.
- The skills that we have picked up along the way include Git, HTML, and CSS. We also familiarized ourselves with many technologies including Slack, GitHub, the command line, and VS Code.
- With all of the curriculum we have covered so far, I want to give everyone the chance to catch up on any missed exercises or progress on our website projects.  
- The goal of this exercise is make sure that you have been successful in building your website alongside the curriculum.

## Mid-Bootcamp Checklist

1. Have you created a GitHub repository for your website? Do you have the repository on your computer?
- [ ] Yes &rarr; Your repository is accessible on GitHub, and you are able to save changes that you make on your computer to GitHub.

- [ ] No  &rarr; Please visit [Setting up Git and GitHub](https://github.com/Alex-V-Huang/NewHopeBootcamp/blob/master/Week1/Week1.2/GitHub_Git_Setup.md) to help you set up your website repository on GitHub and your computer.

2. Is your GitHub repository up-to-date with your website project's folder on your computer?
- [ ] Yes &rarr; Regularly saving your changes to GitHub is a great habit to have. I recommend doing this at least once a day when you make changes.

- [ ] No  &rarr; Walk through the steps in "Making Changes to Your Repository" from [Git Commands](https://github.com/Alex-V-Huang/NewHopeBootcamp/blob/master/Week2/Week2.1/Git_Commands.md) to reflect your website's changes from your computer to GitHub.

3. Does your website repository have an ```index.html``` file?
- [ ] Yes &rarr; ```index.html``` is the place to add content to your website.

- [ ] No  &rarr; Follow the instructions under "Intro to HTML" in [this exercise](https://github.com/Alex-V-Huang/NewHopeBootcamp/blob/master/Week1/Week1.2/Exercises_Setup_and_Intro_to_HTML.md). Take a look at the ```index.html``` file from Week 1.2. Feel free to copy the ```index.html``` file and paste it into your website repository to help you get started.

4. Does your website repository have a ```style.css``` file?
- [ ] Yes &rarr; ```style.css``` is the place to style the content of your website.

- [ ] No  &rarr; Open the ```Intro_to_CSS``` folder from Week 2.1 and try editing ```style.css```.  Once you are familiar with styling a website, create a ```style.css``` file in your website repository and begin adding your own styling.

5. Have you hosted your website on GitHub Pages yet? In other words, are you able to view your website in a browser from any device?

- [ ] Yes &rarr; Your website is viewable online at https://[your-GitHub-username].github.io/[your-website-repository-name]/. For example, my website can be visited at https://alex-v-huang.github.io/NHPB2020/.

- [ ] No  &rarr; Please visit [Hosting Your Website on GitHub](https://github.com/Alex-V-Huang/NewHopeBootcamp/blob/master/Week3/Week3.1/Hosting_Your_Website/Hosting_Your_Website.md) to help you set up your website repository on GitHub and your computer.

6. Continue working on your website! Here are some ideas to incorporate:

- [ ] Add a footer &rarr; Footers [can add valuable information](https://northstreetcreative.com/notes/why-is-your-website-footer-important/) to users. Check out [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_footer.asp) on how to add a footer.

- [ ] Add a favicon &rarr; If you look at the top of your tab in the browser, your website has a default favicon that can changed to your liking. Check out the ```tab favicon``` comment in ```index.html``` from Week 2.2 for an example of how to add a favicon to your website. Feel free to download and use an existing favicon for free from [this website](https://icons8.com/icons/set/favicon).

- [ ] Design a logo &rarr; Websites often have a logo to create an identity and stand out. If you do not already have a logo, [this website](https://app.brandmark.io/v3/) can help you create a logo in seconds. Use Snipping Tool on Windows or ```Shift + Command + 4``` on Mac to save your logo as an image.

- [ ] Use a custom font &rarr; Using default fonts can be limiting or boring. Find a font that fits your website using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Follow the "Overview" section in [Get Started with the Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#overview) to incorporate a Google Font into your website.

- [ ] Add another webpage &rarr; Your website project is likely to expand beyond a homepage. Potential pages include About, Contact Us, Resources, etc. Add relevant pages to your website by creating new ```.html``` files in your website repository, just like how you did with ```index.html```. Feel free to name them however you please (ex: ```about.html```).

- [ ] Adjust how elements occupy space on your website &rarr; The box model helps us understand how elements take up space. Modify ```border```, ```padding```, and ```margin``` in your `.css` file to position elements the way you want. Keep in mind there are more ways to change how elements take up space, such as ```float``` and CSS flexbox.

- [ ] Explore what's online and make your ideas a reality &rarr; There is so much more to building a website than what we've covered so far!
